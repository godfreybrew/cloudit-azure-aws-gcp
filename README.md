Automatic Cloud Posture Audit Tool ‚òÅÔ∏è üî¨  

<img src="docs/images/tool-logo.png" alt="Cloudit Logo" width="250" height="190"> 

## Abstract


`Cloudit` is a script for automatic, multicloud and  multi-tenant *CSPM* (Cloud Security Posture Management).  
The idea is to wrap some usefull open source cloud posture audit tools like [prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler)  behind an higher level abstraction in order to execute the tools in parallel on multiple customer's public cloud accounts.  

> [!WARNING]  
> This tools makes API calls to cloud provider endpoints and services: these calls may be billed by the provider.  

As of right now this only work with `aws`, `azure` and `gcp` and uses json files to store customer credentials (inside the `credentials` folder).  
The *aws* credentials file is called `aws-credentials.json` and it is structured like this:  

```json
{
    "customers": [
        {
            "customer_name": "foo",
            "REGIONS": ["region-1", "region-2"],
            "SERVICES": ["aws_service_1", "aws_service_2"],
            "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "foo-access-key-here",
            "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "foo-secret-access-key-here",
        },
        {
            "customer_name": "godfrey",
            "REGIONS": ["region-1", "region-2", "region-3"],
            "SERVICES": ["aws_service_1", "aws_service_2", "aws_service_3"],
            "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "godfrey-access-key-here",
            "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY":"godfrey-secret-access-key-here"
        }

    ]
}
```
